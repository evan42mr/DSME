The shipbuilding construction process involves assembling
numerous hull block, machinery, equipment, other outfitted items
and subsequent testing. The quality of a ship is determined by the
accurate and controlled construction, assembly and installation of
the various items to a defined acceptable standard.

Workmanship quality is very important, and the only way to attain
the required quality and productivity improvements is to ensure the
desired quality at each stage of production. This is achieved by
each worker following the defined quality standard.

This quality standard consists of 4 parts as following;

Part Ⅰ.      General procedure
Part Ⅱ.      Hull part
Part Ⅲ.      Outfitting & Machinery part
Part Ⅳ.      Painting part


The standards stipulated in this quality standard are generally
applied to shipbuilding at the shipyard. In case of conflict, however, the
requirements of the contract, building specifications, approved drawings
or agreed letters/memorandum shall prevail over this DSQS.

1. CUTTING/FORMING PROCESS
1.1 Control of Steel Materials
 (1) When steel materials are transferred to shot blasting/priming process from steel
     stock area, the designated steel materials should be correctly selected and
     supplied by comparing the identification numbers of the steel materials with the
     “Steel Material Input Order Sheet”.

 (2) Input sequences of steel materials to the shot blasting/priming process are
     controlled by computerized system for correct trace of the materials.

 (3) After blasting/priming, the necessary information such as project no., block no.,
     grade, and applied cutting station no., are marked down on the primed steel
     materials to identify the material.

 (4) At the cutting stage, the cut steel pieces will have the part number by auto-
     marking system. However if it was not applied, the part number has to be
     manually written according to the cutting drawing.

 (5) Accuracy control of steel pieces should be maintained continuously throughout
     the cutting process to minimize welding gaps.

 (6) Following items are to be checked in this process.

1.2 Forming

(1) Mechanical Bending

   The plate having cylindrical shapes is generally formed by a hydraulic press
   using the universal jigs with templet tables. Most templets are produced by a
   computerized system except for manual drawings of fore and stern parts.

(2) Hot Bending

   The plate having compound curves is firstly formed by the mechanical bending
   and finally formed by hot bending with the line-heating or spot heating.

   The applied temperature in hot bending is controlled by means of temperature
   sensitive chalk (Tempil-stick) according to following table.

      block and independent material pieces on the platform or jig, and automatic or
      semi-automatic welding is applicable alternatively according to shape of welding
      parts such as flat plate, curved plate, etc.

  (2) The complicated blocks such as fore or aft parts of hull should be assembled
      with great care to acquire the acceptable accuracy of dimensions.

  (3) After completion of the assembly work, the block is inspected in the presence
      of Classification surveyor and Client's representative. Then, necessary leakage
      tests on the fillet weld parts where watertight is required should be carried out
      by means of fillet air test, vacuum test or other methods which are proved the
      tightness of welded part.

  (4) The inspection of blocks by Client’s representative and Classification Society’s
      surveyor shall be waived and carried out by the Builder’s staff under the
      supervision of Builder’s QM and Classification Society in the process of block
      fabrication provide that the blocks are being fabricated in a workshop or by a
      production team that has been proven its ability to maintain acceptable quality
      level through self-quality control by periodical evaluations of Builder’s QM and
      Classification Society.

4. WELDING PROCESS

 4.1 General

  (1) Since welding is an important work directly related to hull strength, it should be
      carefully controlled according to the welding procedure with the specified
      welding parameters and the repair methods for welding gaps exceeding the
      tolerance limit should be thoroughly controlled.

  (2) When a new welding procedure is necessarily applied, it shall be approved by
      the Classification Society.


 4.2 Preparation before Welding

  (1) All parts to be welded are fitted with sufficient care to their accuracy.
      Edge preparation, angle of bevel, alignment of intercostal plates and fitting
      angles are controlled within the accuracy range specified in the quality
      standard.

  (2) Welding parts shall be free from moisture, loose mill scale, excessive rust or
      harmful paint.

  (3) Tack welding is carried out under the same preparation of welding.

 4.3 Welding

  (1) After confirming the above preparation, welding is carried out according to the
      "Welding Procedure Specification" to minimize deformation and residual
      stress.

  (2) Electrodes, welding method, welding condition shall be in accordance with
      "Welding Procedure Specification" and requirements of the Classification
      Society.

  (3) After completion of welding, if necessary, the weld lines are touched up with a
      zinc epoxy primer to prevent rusting.

4.4 Inspection on Weld Parts

    Following inspections are carried out to verify the quality of weld parts.

     (1) Visual inspection

        (a) Visual inspection is carried out on all beads. Any defect parts found are
            marked on the block and properly corrected.

        (b) The welding throat of fillet weld is to be checked by random sampling.

     (2) Non-destructive examination

        (a) Welded joints of strength deck plates, bottom and side shell plates are
            tested by the radiographic examination or ultrasonic flaw detector
            according to NDE plan which is approved by the Classification Society.

        (b) Magnetic particle test or dye-penetration test is to be adopted for
            detecting the surface defect.

1. PIPING PROCESS

1.1 Pipe Bending

  (1) Pipe bending is to be carried out by the cold bending machine having bending
     radius of approximately 2∼3 times the outside diameter of the pipe.

  (2) Ellipticity, swells and rumples caused by bending of pipes shall not exceed the
      quality standards para. 3.2.

  (3) In case the regular pipe bending, as mentioned above, cannot be applied due
       to following reasons, the commercial bent pipe is to be used.

     (a) When the capacity of existing bending machine is not enough to bend,
     (b) When the non-standard bending radius is necessary to facilitate the piping
         arrangement.

  (4) The commercial bent pipe should be of seam or seamless for general piping
      systems for those of nominal dia. 200mm below, and the fabricated pieces
      may be commonly used for those of nominal dia. 200mm and above, if there
      is no specific requirements from the Classification Society.

  (5) In case the arrangement is difficult to use the commercial bent pipe, the miter
       welding pipe having a radius approximately equal to the nominal pipe diameter
       is to be applied. However, the miter welding method is to be applied only to
       low pressure and large size pipes, such as exhaust gas, sea water, exhaust
       steam piping, etc.

  (6) Hot bending or High frequency bending may be applied in accordance with the
      requirements of the Classification Society as a special case.

  (7) For adjustment of pipe alignment at pipe installation stage, hot process could
      be restrictively applied.

1.2 Finishing of Weld Parts after Pipe Fabrication

    Weld beads on inside surface of fabricated pipes shall be finished to suit the
    intended purpose of the respective piping system in accordance with the
    following three grades.

    <GRADE A>

    (1) Weld beads of pipe insides shall be finished smoothly, and welding spatters
        and slag shall be removed.

    (2) This grade applies to lubricating oil pipes, hydraulic oil pipes, fuel oil injection
        pipes after the 2nd filter for main diesel engine, turbine steam pipes and for
        synthetic rubber or plastic lined pipes.

    <GRADE B>

    (1) Welding spatters and slag shall be removed and welded beads shall be
        cleaned.

    (2) This grade applies to power steam pipes, turbine exhaust pipes, cryogenic
        pipes, fuel oil service pipes, drinking water pipes, nozzle cooling pipes, feed
        water pipes, condensate water pipes, sea water cooling pipes, compressed
        air pipes, tank cleaning pipes and vent pipe for cargo tanks.

    <GRADE C>

    (1) Weld beads of pipe insides do not need to be finished.

    (2) This grade applies to all other pipes which are not specified in GRADE A and
        GRADE B, and open ended lines like drains, overflows, vents and boiler
        escape pipes.

1.3 Flange Fitting in Shop

     When the pipe is inserted into the flange for joining, inserting depth should be
     controlled so that the welding bead will not overpass the flange face. The flange
     face is usually not finished by grinding, but welding spatters and slag on its face
     shall be removed.

    to QISSP DPt 2∼3(equivalent to ISO 8501-1 St 2∼3) and
    immediately primed with Builder’s standard touch-up primer to prevent rusting
    before secondary surface preparation where exposed to weather.



 1.4 Hull Block Painting

  (1) After finishing the hull block construction works, coating is to be applied. If the
      surface cleaning work of the block is partially proceeded and not completed on
      the whole block for some reason, the coating could be applied to the cleaned
      surface only before it becomes rusting.

  (2) Outfitting works on the hull block are to be carried out before or after painting
      works according to the construction schedule.
