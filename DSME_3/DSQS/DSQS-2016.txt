                              PREFACE

The shipbuilding construction process involves assembling
numerous hull block, machinery, equipment, other outfitted items
and subsequent testing. The quality of a ship is determined by
the accurate and controlled construction, assembly and
installation of the various items to a defined acceptable
standard.

Workmanship quality is very important, and the only way to attain
the required quality and productivity improvements is to ensure
the desired quality at each stage of production. This is achieved
by each worker following the defined quality standard.

This quality standard consists of 4 parts as following;

Part Ⅰ.     General procedure
Part Ⅱ.     Hull part
Part Ⅲ.     Outfitting & Machinery part
Part Ⅳ.     Painting part

The standards stipulated in this quality standard are generally
applied to shipbuilding at the shipyard. In case of conflict, however, the
requirements of the contract, building specifications, approved drawings
or agreed letters/memorandum shall prevail over this DSQS.

1. CUTTING/FORMING PROCESS
1.1 Control of Steel Materials
 (1) When steel materials are transferred to shot blasting/priming process from
     steel stock area, the designated steel materials should be correctly selected
     and supplied by comparing the identification numbers of the steel materials
     with the “Steel Material Input Order Sheet”.

 (2) Input sequences of steel materials to the shot blasting/priming process are
     controlled by computerized system for correct trace of the materials.

 (3) After blasting/priming, the necessary information such as project no., block no.,
     grade, and applied cutting station no., are marked down on the primed steel
     materials to identify the material.

 (4) At the cutting stage, the part numbers of each cut steel pieces are clearly
     marked according to the cutting drawing.

 (5) Accuracy control of steel pieces should be maintained continuously throughout
     the cutting process to minimize welding gaps.

 (6) Following items are to be checked in this process.

1.2 Forming

 (1) Mechanical Bending

    The plate having cylindrical shapes is generally formed by a hydraulic press
    using the universal jigs with templet tables. Most templets are produced by a
    computerized system except for manual drawings of fore and stern parts.

 (2) Hot Bending

    The plate having compound curves is firstly formed by the mechanical
    bending and finally formed by hot bending with the line-heating or spot
    heating.

    The applied temperature in hot bending is controlled by means of temperature
    sensitive chalk(Tempil-stick) according to following table.

      builder’s inspector.
      Then, necessary leakage tests on the fillet welds where water tightness is
      required should be carried out by means of fillet air test, vacuum test or other
      proper methods.

 2.2 Assembly

  (1) Block assembly is a process of assembly / welding together with sub-assembled
      block and independent material pieces on the platform or jig, and automatic or
      semi-automatic welding is applicable alternatively according to shape of
      welding parts such as flat plate, curved plate, etc..

  (2) The complicated blocks such as fore or aft parts of hull should be assembled
      with great care to acquire the acceptable accuracy of dimensions.

  (3) After completion of the assembly work, the block is inspected in the presence
      of Classification surveyor and Client's representative. Then, necessary leakage
      tests on the fillet weld parts where watertight is required should be carried
      out by means of fillet air test, vacuum test or other methods which are
      proved the tightness of welded part.

  (4) The inspection of blocks by Client’s representative and Classification
     Society’s surveyor shall be waived and carried out by the Builder’s staff under
     the supervision of Builder’s QM and Classification Society in the process of
     block fabrication provide that the blocks are being fabricated in a workshop or
     by a production team that has been proven its ability to maintain acceptable
     quality level through self-quality control by periodical evaluations of Builder’s
     QM and Classification Society.

4. WELDING PROCESS

 4.1 General

  (1) Since welding is an important work directly related to hull strength, it should
      be carefully controlled according to the welding procedure with the specified
      welding parameters and the repair methods for welding gaps exceeding the
      tolerance limit should be thoroughly controlled.

  (2) When a new welding procedure is necessarily applied, it shall be approved
      by the Classification Society.


 4.2 Preparation before Welding

  (1) All parts to be welded are fitted with sufficient care to their accuracy.
      Edge-preparation, angle of bevel, alignment of intercostals plates and fitting
      angles are controlled within the accuracy range specified in the quality
      standard.

  (2) Welding parts shall be free from moisture, loose mill scale, excessive rust or
      harmful paint.

  (3) Tack welding is carried out under the same preparation of welding.

 4.3 Welding

  (1) After confirming the above preparation, welding is carried out according to
      the "Welding Procedure Specification" to minimize deformation and residual
      stress.

  (2) Electrodes, welding method, welding condition shall be in accordance with
      "Welding Procedure Specification" and requirements of the Classification
      Society.

 (3) After completion of welding, if necessary, the weld lines are touched up with
     a zinc epoxy primer to prevent rusting.

4.4 Inspection on Weld Parts

   Following inspections are carried out to verify the quality of weld parts.

   (1) Visual inspection

         (a) Visual inspection is carried out on all beads. Any defect parts found are
             marked on the block and properly corrected.

         (b) The welding throat of fillet weld is to be checked by random sampling.

   (2) Non-destructive examination

         (a) Welded joints of strength deck plates, bottom and side shell plates are
             tested by the radiographic examination or ultrasonic flaw detector
             according to NDE plan which is approved by the Classification Society.

         (b) Magnetic particle test or dye-penetration test is to be adopted for
             detecting the surface defect.

1. PIPING PROCESS

 1.1 Pipe Bending

  (1) Pipe bending is to be carried out by the cold bending machine having
     bending radius of approximately 2∼3 times the outside diameter of the pipe.

  (2) Ellipticity, swells and rumples caused by bending of pipes shall not exceed
      the quality standards para. 3.2.

  (3) In case the regular pipe bending, as mentioned above, can not be applied
      due to following reasons, the commercial bent pipe is to be used.

     (a) When the capacity of existing bending machine is not enough to bend,
     (b) When the non-standard bending radius is necessary to facilitate the
         piping arrangement.

  (4) The commercial bent pipe should be of seam or seamless for general piping
      systems for those of nominal dia. 200mm below, and the fabricated pieces
      may be commonly used for those of nominal dia. 200mm and above, if there
      is no specific requirements from the Classification Society.

  (5) In case the arrangement is difficult to use the commercial bent pipe, the miter
       welding pipe having a radius approximately equal to the nominal pipe
       diameter is to be applied. However, the miter welding method is to be applied
       only to low pressure and large size pipes, such as exhaust gas, sea water,
       exhaust steam piping, etc.

  (6) Hot bending or High frequency bending may be applied in accordance with
      the requirements of the Classification Society as a special case.

  (7) For adjustment of pipe alignment at pipe installation stage, hot process could
      be restrictively applied.

1.2 Finishing of Weld Parts after Pipe Fabrication

   Weld beads on inside surface of fabricated pipes shall be finished to suit the
   intended purpose of the respective piping system in accordance with the
   following three grades.

   <GRADE A>

   (1) Weld beads of pipe insides shall be finished smoothly, and welding spatters
       and slag shall be removed.

   (2) This grade applies to lubricating oil pipes, hydraulic oil pipes, fuel oil
       injection pipes after the 2nd filter for main diesel engine, turbine steam
       pipes and for synthetic rubber or plastic lined pipes.

   <GRADE B>

   (1) Welding spatters and slag shall be removed and welded beads shall be
       cleaned.

   (2) This grade applies to power steam pipes, turbine exhaust pipes, cryogenic
       pipes, fuel oil service pipes, drinking water pipes, nozzle cooling pipes,
       feed water pipes, condensate water pipes, sea water cooling pipes,
       compressed air pipes, tank cleaning pipes and vent pipe for cargo tanks.

   <GRADE C>

   (1) Weld beads of pipe insides do not need to be finished.

   (2) This grade applies to all other pipes which are not specified in GRADE A
       and GRADE B, and open ended lines like drains, overflows, vents and
       boiler escape pipes.


1.3 Flange Fitting in Shop

    When the pipe is inserted into the flange for joining, inserting depth should be
    controlled so that the welding bead will not overpass the flange face. The
    flange face is usually not finished by grinding, but welding spatters and slag
    on its face shall be removed.
                                                                      (DSME_DSQS_2016)

1. PAINTING PROCESS

 1.1 General

  (1) Painting work will be carried out basically according to the Builder's standard
      of QISSP(Quality and Inspection Standard for Ships Painting) and the paint
      manufacturer's recommendation. Painting work is also proceeded according
      to the Builder's building schedule for smooth construction progress.

  (2) All painting works are inspected in accordance with the painting specifications,
      drawings and QISSP.



 1.2 Surface Preparation

    Details of de-rusting standard and surface cleaning standard are to be referred
    to in QISSP chapter 1 "Quality & Insp. Standard for Surface Preparation".



 1.3 Repair Priming at Assembly Shops

    Burn damaged parts of shop primer by welding are to be mechanically
    cleaned to QISSP DPt 2∼3(equivalent to ISO 8501-1 St 2∼3) and
    immediately primed with Builder’s standard touch-up primer to prevent rusting
    before secondary surface preparation where exposed to weather.



 1.4 Hull Block Painting

  (1) After finishing the hull block construction works, coating is to be applied. If the
      surface cleaning work of the block is partially proceeded and not completed
      on the whole block for some reason, the coating could be applied to the
      cleaned surface only before it becomes rusting.

  (2) Outfitting works on the hull block are to be carried out before or after painting
      works according to the construction schedule.

1.5 Correction of Trivial Defects

 (1) Trivial defects or damages which are not detected at block inspection but
     found after surface preparation (sand blasting, etc.) are to be corrected by
     welding, chipping and/or grinding and then touch up with paint.

 (2) Paint repair work shall be carried out in accordance with the Builder's practice
     and inspection standards.



1.6 Finishing of Free Edges of Steel and Welded Beads

    Free edges of steel members cut by gas cutting and irregular welding beads
    in heavy corrosive area such as water ballast tanks and fresh water tanks are
    to be carefully treated in accordance with the Builder's practice.
